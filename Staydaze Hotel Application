//Program File Name: assesment_2.java
//Program Name: Assesment 2 - Staydaze Hotel Application 
//Program Purpose: The purpose of this program is to collect the personal information about the clients of Hotel Daze and to present this information in the requested format.
 // Information requested: The information requested from the client includes first, last and middle name; street number, name and street; city and age. 
    //The requested format presents the clients first and middle names as the first initials followed by full stops and the last name on the output line 1. 
       //Output line 2 presents the clients entered street number, name and type together. 
         //Output line 3 presents the clients city
           //Output line 4 presents the clients age, as categorized by age brackets.
